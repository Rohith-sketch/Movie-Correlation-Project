# Movie-Correlation-Project
An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of movie data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover patterns and correlations. The analysis reveals that budget and gross earnings show the highest positive correlation.

# Movie Data Analysis – Budget vs Gross Correlation

## 📌 Overview
This project explores a movie dataset to understand relationships between different features, focusing on the correlation between **budget** and **gross earnings**.  
The workflow includes:
- Data cleaning (handling nulls, dropping duplicates)
- Data transformation (converting categorical values to numeric codes)
- Correlation analysis
- Data visualization

## 📊 Key Finding
The **budget** and **gross earnings** columns show the highest positive correlation in the dataset.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib** – for visualizations  
- **Seaborn** – for statistical plots and correlation heatmaps  

## 📂 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
2. Cleaned the data:
   - Removed null values in key columns.
   - Dropped duplicate entries.
   - Converted categorical variables to numeric codes.
3. Performed correlation analysis for numeric data.
4. Visualized correlations using Seaborn heatmaps.
5. Highlighted the strong correlation between **budget** and **gross earnings**.
